Your written musing content goes here.

Write freely, share your thoughts, and express your reflections.

You can use multiple paragraphs.

## Add Headings If You Like

Use markdown formatting to structure your thoughts.

**Bold** and *italic* text work too.

- You can include
- Bullet points
- If helpful

> You can even add block quotes for emphasis.

## Tips:
- Category can be "thinking", "feeling", or "doing"
- If including audio, upload MP3 to /public/audio/musings/ first
- To get audio duration in seconds: length in minutes × 60
  - Example: 7 minutes = 420 seconds
- Use tags that relate to the theme or topic
- Keep the description brief - it's the introduction shown in lists
