# Internal Working Directory

Private workspace for development analyses, AI critiques, and internal working documents.

## Purpose

This directory contains internal working materials that inform development decisions but are not intended for public sharing or implementation tracking in the main documentation.

## Structure

```
internal/
├── ai-critiques/    # AI agent analyses and critiques
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Usage

**ai-critiques/**
- Dump AI-generated website critiques, analyses, and commentary here
- No specific naming convention required - use what works for you
- Reference these when making design/architecture decisions
- Extract actionable items into `/feedback/` structure if/when appropriate

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **`/docs/`** - Technical documentation, iteration reports (public/tracked)
- **`/feedback/`** - Structured feedback for public sharing and tracking
- **`/notes/`** - Internal analysis and roadmap notes
- **`/internal/`** - Raw working materials, AI critiques (private)

Think of this as your "scratch space" for collecting insights before deciding what to formalize.
